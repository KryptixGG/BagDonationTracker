How to know, if database is up to date, when comparing?
	1. maybe Hash based on entire database, or is that too much processing?
!	2. increasing database version numbers
		- requires saving other peoples version numbers
		- some system to make these impossible to reach maximum
!!!	3. Have latest Sync Timestamps for every known player


How to sync? Allways have both sending full database to each other requires too much sending
	1. add a mark to every db entry about who this was already send to
		- only works with small amount of users
		- dont know how much faster this is in terms of computing
	2. add a mark to every db entry about who this WASNT already send to
		- only works with small amount of users
		- dont know how much faster this is in terms of computing
		- dont know if this is better or worse, than 1.
	3. have a seperate log with all entires modified + timestamp, then add a mark for all known users this was send to. Delete entries that were send to all known users.
		When adding new known user, do a full sync of the entire Database
			- log mights get extremely big, if 1 known user doesnt login often or quits entirely
				- maybe delete known users after long time without sync
					- what is "long", so that the log doesnt get too big, but is still realistic for users to be this active
!			- helps with the issue of how to handle manually deleted entries
!!	4. have a hash for each entry for faster comparison on full database syncs
!!!	5. im chatGPT log "Data Synchronization in WoW" scheint mir n guter Ansatz zu sein
		- am Anfang ohne Bloom Filter, den kann ich ja später hinzufügen, falls ich will und es nötig ist



How to handle manually deleted entries?
!	1. I dont, there is no manual deletion. If there is need for that - just send that guy bags manually.

When to sync?
	1. at addon startup and button click
		- only possible, if sync doesnt require too much computing
	2. only at button click
!!!	3. check at addon startup and print message if sync necessary, but only DO at button click
		- requires users to read chat at startup
			- maybe add a reminder into addon-options next to the advertising and recipient collection button



If only sync with known players - how to know players?
	1. hardcode my name and take a List from me
		- prevents all abuse from random players
		- requires me to be online very often
	2. hardcode my name and take a List from me, but use all players on the List in the future
		- prevents some abuse from random players
		- will work even when I stop being online
		- 1 known player adding a abusive player to the List corrupts it forever
!!	3. have players manually add players to a "sync with xy"-list, (a. maybe hardcode me)
		- more work for users
!		a. when I quit, might be abuseable by someone taking my name in future
			- could be too unlikely to bother
			- ensures people have some data from me at the start, when I am still active
